2.1.1

Background Reading
OpenGL and GLSL

Prior to beginning this project, I had very little knowledge of OpenGL barring a
small amount of personal experience writing toy programs in my spare time. As
such I needed to gain a better understanding of OpenGL, and some knowledge
of GLSL before I could begin this project.

3.2

Parser

It was decided that due to time constraints, and the lack of a pressing need for an
unusual parser, a parser generator would be used. Initially I chose to use JS/CC
[REF], since it seemed well-documented and quite popular. However, once I had
used it to generate an appropriate parser for GLSL, it quickly became apparent
that the parser was insuﬃciently fast to use for such a complicated grammar. In
fact, I was unable to obtain any timing for the parser, as under Google Chrome,
even with the simplest inputs it would fail to produce any output before Chrome
itself decided to kill the process. While it may have been possible to obtain timing
information, this was clearly to slow to be of any value. I then found Jison [REF],
a JavaScript port of Bison. This was able to parse even quite complicated input
in a reasonable amount of time, as is discussed in my evaluation.
